## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The solution involves developing an AI-powered mobile and voice-based advisory system tailored for small and marginal farmers. The system will provide real-time, personalized recommendations on crop selection, fertilizer use, pest management, and irrigation scheduling based on soil data, weather conditions, and past cropping history. Farmers will be able to upload crop images for disease and pest detection, receive localized weather alerts, and access real-time market rates. The platform will support multiple Indian languages with voice-based assistance to ensure accessibility for low-literacy farmers.

The uniqueness lies in combining AI, natural language processing, and image recognition with multilingual voice support for a farmer-friendly experience. The integration of predictive analytics for yield optimization and localized advisory sets it apart from generic agricultural apps.

Technical Approach
The system will be implemented as a mobile-first application supported by backend AI services.

Technologies:

AI/ML for crop advisory, pest/disease image recognition, and predictive analytics.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual chatbot and voice support.

Cloud databases for storing soil, weather, and market data.

Mobile app frameworks (React Native/Flutter) for accessibility on Android devices.

IoT integration (optional) for soil sensor data.

Implementation Methodology:

Data collection and model training using agricultural datasets.

Integration of NLP for local language chat/voice support.

Development of mobile app with farmer-friendly UI.

Pilot testing in selected villages with feedback collection.

Scaled deployment through government schemes and cooperatives.

## Feasibility and Viability
The idea is feasible given the increasing access to smartphones and mobile networks in rural India. Partnerships with agricultural universities, government departments, and agri-tech startups can provide data and resources.

Challenges:

Low digital literacy among farmers.

Connectivity issues in remote areas.

Ensuring accuracy of AI-based recommendations.

Strategies to Address Challenges:

Voice-based and icon-driven UI for ease of use.

Offline functionality with periodic updates.

Continuous model training and validation with real field data.

## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact: Empowers farmers with knowledge and reduces dependency on middlemen.
Economic Impact: Increases yield and profitability while reducing input costs.
Environmental Benefits: Promotes judicious use of fertilizers and pesticides, contributing to sustainable farming.
Policy Benefits: Supports government initiatives like Digital India and Smart Agriculture.
